# location-prediction-for-tweets
User Location Prediction by there Tweets.  
Designing a Deep learning Model that can predict a user's location based on his/her tweets.  
It uses Multi-head Self-attention model.  
Three different models are generated and each model runs individually and display its accuracy.  
(Three models were used to compare the accuracy between them).  

--Code contains 3 Files.  
1. train1.csv is data file used for training and testing.
2. model1.py contains the actual code.
3. model1.txt is just the text version of model1.py
